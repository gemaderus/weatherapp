# WeatherApp

App for geolocalization, gives you the temperature of the day and the weekly forecast. You can get the temperature in Celsius or Farenheit degrees.

I have developed this app for Free Code Camp, to get the certification for intermediate level frontend developer.

WatherApp uses two apis: http://ip-api.com/json and http://api.openweathermap.org. It is made with jquery in the master branch and in Vanilla Javascript in js branch.
